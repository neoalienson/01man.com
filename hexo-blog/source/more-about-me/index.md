## When did I start using the name Neo

Many people link my English name Neo with the film Matrix. In fact, I have been using this English name for over 20 years. Before the dawn of Internet, we communicate around the globe with Bulletin board system (BBS) over telephone lines with modems. My original English name Leo collides with other BBS users and I have to pick another one. I choose Neo and keep using it even it collides with other users from Latin America.
