Many people know how to capture screen into a file on Mac by using <kbd>Command<kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> for a full screenshot and <kbd>4</kbd> for cross hair selection tool. However, I found I want to paste the captured image into an editor directly more than saving the image into a file. The hotkey for taking a screenshot to the clipboard is very inconvenient, which is <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>4</kbd>. The following steps show how to reassign the shortcuts for taking a screenshot to the clipboard instead of a file.

1\. Go to System Preference and click Keyboard,

2\. Click on the second key to reassign <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>  for "Copy picture of screen to the clipboard". It is fine to see the conflict icon as it will be resolved later

3\. Click the first key to reassign the <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> , which is less frequnelty using.

4\. Do the same for capturing with cross hair selection tool. My personal preference for taking screenshot to a file is <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> ,
