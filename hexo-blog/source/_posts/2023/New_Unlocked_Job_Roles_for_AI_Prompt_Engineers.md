While graphics prompt engineers focus on the technical aspects of graphics design, such as developing prompt, train models, or optimizing performance, traditional graphics designers focus on the artistic aspects, such as creating visual concepts, selecting colors, and designing layouts.

By working together, graphics prompt engineers and traditional graphics designers can leverage each other's strengths to create effective and visually appealing products or projects. For example, the engineer may be able to develop prompt that enables a designer to create more complex and dynamic graphics, while the designer can provide creative input to ensure that the graphics are aesthetically pleasing and aligned with the project's objectives.

We've also seen the emergence of "Legal Prompt Engineers." These professionals have a background in law and deep knowledge of language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. They work closely with lawyers and law firms to revolutionize the legal industry by designing and developing high-quality prompts for various legal and non-legal use cases.
