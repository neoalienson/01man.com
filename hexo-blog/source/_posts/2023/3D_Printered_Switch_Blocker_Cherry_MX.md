Are you tired of accidentally hitting the wrong keys on your keyboard? Do you find yourself losing precious time because of a rogue Caps Lock or Windows key? Or maybe you're like me and have a keyboard with more keys than you actually need after mapping, leaving you with unnecessary clutter. Fear not, my friend, for there is a solution to this all-too-common problem: a 3D printed switch blocker for Cherry MX switches!

The size of the switch blocker is a perfect square of 18.8x18.8mm, with a height of 1mm. However, if you're worried about blocking LED light, you may need to increase the thickness. No worries though, because you can easily modify the design to make it work for you.
![1mm thickness allows LED light to pass through, which could be a desirable feature for those who want to maintain the backlighting.](switch_blocker1.jpg)

But what really sets this switch blocker apart is the notch on all sides. This ensures that the switch blocker stays securely in place and doesn't pop out at the most inconvenient times. So whether you're in the middle of a high-stakes game or a crucial work project, you can rest assured that your switch blocker will stay put.

And the best part? You can download the [model for this switch blocker from Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aT6I7tsexoG), a free 3D modeling website. So even if you don't have any 3D modeling skills, you can still create your own custom switch blockers! And if you're worried about the cost, don't be. You can [link many switch blockers together](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6U7lJd8b9Fi?sharecode=Anf6vjscTHOeSjvyDMEttp3APrW4AjivryzTe-dlMf4) to save on printing costs. In fact, you can get 40 switch blockers for around 10 USD, including shipping from mainland to Hong Kong when you order from Taoboa.

So, what are you waiting for? Say goodbye to those frustrating accidental key presses and hello to a more efficient and enjoyable typing or gaming experience with your very own 3D printed switch blocker for Cherry MX switches. Happy printing!
